# Taran's 7.1 Downmix Renderer Suite

A premium Windows WASAPI downmix renderer designed for seamless routing of multichannel audio (via VB-CABLE capture endpoints) into high-quality stereo DAC output. Built for precision, performance, and a polished, professional experience.

---

## Highlights

- OLED-black interface with a fully custom window frame  
- WASAPI-only device handling for clean, low-latency routing  
- High-precision downmix processing with consistent channel mapping  
- Native Windows volume-key integration via CoreAudio  
- Independent Suite Volume and Preamp controls  
- Advanced preset system (create, update, delete, instant switching)  
- Intelligent preset switching based on active output device  
- Optional auto-start on system boot  
- Real-time 7.1 channel visualization:

## Prerequisites & Initial Setup

Before using the renderer, complete the following setup:

### 1. Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable
Install VB-CABLE for Windows — this acts as the virtual audio bridge.

---

### 2. Configure VB-CABLE Format
- Go to Sound Settings → Playback Devices  
- Open CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)  
- Navigate to Properties → Advanced  
- Set:
- 16 channel, 24-bit, 48000 Hz  

---

### 3. Enable 7.1 Speaker Configuration
- Open Control Panel → Sound  
- Right-click CABLE Output  
- Select Configure Speakers  
- Set to 7.1 Surround  

---

### 4. Configure Renderer Devices

Inside the app (WASAPI category only):

- Input:  
CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable) (48 kHz)

- Output:  
Your DAC / speakers / Bluetooth device  

---

### 5. Start Playback
- Click Start  
- Play audio from your source  

---

## Important Notes

- Only use WASAPI devices inside the app  
- Ensure VB-CABLE is configured correctly before launch  
- Incorrect setup may result in:
- Missing channels  
- No audio  
- Incorrect downmix  

---

## Quick Start

### Run from source:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\taran\Documents\Playground\downmix-renderer-research"
python renderer_app.py
````

### Run packaged app:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\taran\Documents\Playground\downmix-renderer-research"
.\dist\TaransDownmixRendererSuite.exe
```

---

## Presets System

The app starts with zero presets by design.

### Usage:

1. Select WASAPI input/output
2. Adjust Preamp, Suite Volume, channel config
3. Enter name → click New
4. Switch instantly via preset buttons
5. Use Update to overwrite
6. Use Delete to remove

### Each preset stores:

* Device identities
* Preamp
* Suite Volume
* Channel layout
* Output matching behavior

All saves are atomic (no partial or corrupted states).

---

## Smart Device Switching

* Automatically detects active Windows output device
* Matches and applies corresponding preset
* Seamless switching during runtime

Manual selection always overrides auto behavior.

---

## Auto Start

Enable Auto Start Renderer on System Boot:

* Launches with Windows
* Restores last state
* Starts processing automatically

No admin rights required.

---

## Channel Layouts

### Default 7.1:

```
FL FR FC LFE BL BR SL SR
```

### Extended Diagnostic Mode:

16-channel monitoring view for advanced routing analysis.

---

## Route Probe (Diagnostics)

### Scan devices:

```powershell
python -m downmix_renderer.route_probe --duration 0 --output route_probe_inventory.json
```

### Monitor live activity:

```powershell
python -m downmix_renderer.route_probe --duration 20 --output route_probe_apple_music.json
```

### Results:

* channels_above_8_detected → full multichannel path
* eight_or_fewer_channels → system limitation
* no_signal → routing issue

---

## Development

### Run tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### Build executable:

```powershell
python scripts\make_icon.py
pyinstaller --noconfirm renderer_app.spec
```

You can paste this **directly into GitHub README.md** — it’ll render perfectly.

If you want next upgrade, I can:
- Add **badges + screenshots (top-tier repo look)**
- Or make this feel like a **real product page (like a startup landing)**
```
